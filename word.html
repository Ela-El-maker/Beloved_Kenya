              no one should interpret with his own thoughts,<br>
              but faithfully deliver the true meaning.<br><br>

            <b>2 Timothy 3:15-17</b><br>
            and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
            All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,
            so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.<br><br>

            <b>Matthew 5:19</b><br>
            Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do
            the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches
            these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

            <b>Deuteronomy 8:3</b><br>
            He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your fathers had known,
            to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.<br><br>

            <b>Matthew 4:4</b><br>
            Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"

          <h4 class="dolor777">For the Gospel bears great power, it has to transform people</h4>
          <div class="textbox_minis">
            <b>Romans 1:16</b><br>
            I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes.<br><br>

            <b>1 Corinthians 1:18, 24</b><br>
            For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.<br>
            but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.<br><br>

            <b>Hebrews 4:12</b><br>
            For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword,
            it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow;
            it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.<br><br>

            <b>1 Corinthians 4:20</b><br>
            For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.

        <div class="contBox_02 bg_828a80">
          <h4 class="textleftt">Jesus must be testified through sermons (2 Corinthians 11:2)</h4>
          <div class="textbox_about">
            We must look for a church where the pastor leads people to Christ, not to his preaching or gifts.
            Many sermons exalt human effort, yet fail to point hearts back to Jesus.
            True ministry leads believers into intimacy with the Bridegroom, not admiration of the preacher.
            <br><br>
            Some preachers perform miracles and signs, but their people do not grow in love for Jesus.
            Others boast of their sacrifices and charity, but not of the cross.
            A true servant leads hearts to Jesus, not to himself.

            He will glorify Me by taking from what is Mine and making it known to you."<br><br>

            <b>1 Corinthians 2:12-13</b><br>
            We have received the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.<br><br>

            <b>Ephesians 1:17</b><br>
            I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father,
            may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better.<br><br>

            <b>Ephesians 6:19</b><br>
            Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me
            so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel.<br><br>

            <b>Psalm 119:18</b><br>
