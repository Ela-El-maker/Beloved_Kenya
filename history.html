  In June 2023, a general pastors and leaders seminar was attended by 1500 servants of God. The seminar stired up the hunger and thirst for the beginning of restoration of the true doctrine of Christ in the churhes in kenya, and in October 2023, the very first lot of <strong>208 pastors were received in Kanduyi, in Bungoma County and became part of Beloved Church branch pastors.</strong></div>

        <div class="historyContent">
          <p>
            The journey of <strong>Beloved Church Kenya</strong> began with a divine burden; to restore
            the altar of love, truth, and holiness across the land. What started as a small gathering of
            hungry believers at a general pastors and leaders conference at <strong>Full Gospel Church Malaba Town.</strong>,
            soon became a movement of revival, touching regions and hearts with the fire of God through the <strong>Three Fold Ministries</strong> that Jesus did according to <strong>Matthew 4:23.
          </strong></p>

          <p><strong>2022:</strong> The vision was birthed through prayer and fasting, as the Lord began to raise
          watchmen for the nation.</p>

          <p><strong>2023:</strong> National conferences were birthed — moments marked by prophetic encounters,
          healings, and the manifestation of God’s glory.</p>

          <p><strong>June 2024:</strong> The ministry received another set of pastors in Eldoret Town, Uasin Gishu County.</p>
          <p><strong>September 2024:</strong> The ministry received another group of pastors in Machakos Town, Machakos County.</p>
          <p><strong>October 2024:</strong> The ministry received another team of pastors in Nyali Town Mombasa County.</p>
          <p><strong>June 2024:</strong> The ministry received another set of pastors in Eldoret Town, Uasin Gishu County.</p>
          <p><strong>September 2025:</strong> The ministry received another set of pastors in Kisumu Town, Kisumu County.</p>

          <p><strong>To date:</strong> The journey continues as we build altars of revival and consecration across Kenya and beyond.</p>
